Developing Tools for Lighter game ([repo here](https://github.com/lukaszszymankiewicz/lighter))

This toolschains will contain:
 - [ ] level editor
 - [ ] sprite/animations/hitbox editor
 - [ ] light effect sketcher

----

The goal of this tools are to ease developing Lighter game, learn how to use Go programming
language, and create and create such a program that will allow anybody to make their own creations
(propably this means that this set of tools will entirely work on browser).

Project is on its very beggining, so even a set of requirements for such, does not exist by now.
