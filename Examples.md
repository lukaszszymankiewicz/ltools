1. Adding new entity:
 - Just paste the entity image to editor/assets/entity_tileset.png (use existing file). Remember
   that position of the entity in the tileset will be used as entity index in the game. Tileset
   should not be wider than 10 tiles (editor will work this thing out, but this is just a usefil
   convention for debgging).
